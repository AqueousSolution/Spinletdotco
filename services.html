             <p class="servicescontents">At Spinlet, we believe that:<br><br>

                    “Every content creator should have the opportunity to express their creativity.
                    Every content creator should have the opportunity to be heard and loved by others.
                    Every content creator should have the opportunity to live out their dreams, unhindered”.
                    <br><br>
                    For this reason, we created the product RABA.<br><br>
                    Raba is a content distribution platform that connects African Content Creators and the rest of the world. Raba focuses on the distribution of four main products – Music, Movies, Books and Podcasts.
